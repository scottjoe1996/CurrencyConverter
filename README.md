This program allows the user to convert currency between US dollars, Pound sterling or Euro.

When you start the program you will be given three choices of currency you wish to convert from, inputing 1, 2 or 3 will choose Pound sterling, US dollar or Euro respectively.

After that you can insert the a postive number which represents the amount of money to convert.

Finally you will be given two choices of currency you wish to convert to by inputting 1 or2. Afterwards you will be given the amount you wanted to convert and the conversion.

I choose this as I thought it would be the easiest to impliment methods from chapters 1-10.
 
A jar file is available to run this program: Proj1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
